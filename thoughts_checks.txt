"ech'o'"|"" d'f'wpr" segfault if unclosed quotes, no segfault anymore
"echo| d'f'wpr segfault if unclosed quotes, no segfault anymore
for tomorrow, 
-syntax error the quotes,
-test expansion more, incase of  ''check for cmd if its cmd 
-strdup('') else just strdup() 


to do list:
* start working on exit codes, use WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNAL or something and signal one for segfault ctrlc and stuff(DONE, i guess)
* fix echo -n flag
* expand the here_doc input, so before storing it check if there is a dollar sign, if there do the same process of expand_tokens function, is call our expand
* create a function that cleans everything 


ok command not found done 127,
invalid input done 1
for builtins its not working, invalid command | builtin, exit code stays 127, if its ls | cd asdas, exit code =1 works fine
need also the 126 

asdasd <sd | pwd invalid file descriptor -1 in syscall close(), so i think its if i have a builtin after a invalid input file, because invalid or normal commands doesnt have the error
syscall solved it was inside builtin_pipeline function closing fd[0] without checking and in that case there fd[0] wasnt open to begin with

126 done, error messages i think is done aswell, just check with mac when u go tomorrow or today,
solved invalid command | builtin issue,
i catch segfault and change exit_code to that
i think exit_codes is done
