Error message for cd, 
cd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
Echo $? -> 0


say im in directory a/b/c
/*Well I delete the parent directory and I am inside the child directory, 
when I try to cd .. chdir doesn’t fail but If I add error message in get_pwd 
It will be printed out twice, and pads in the env list is fucked in this situation, 
maybe I need to handle “..” Path on its own in a separate function, where I check 
if the directory is available is something*/
!!semi solved just make sure if i pwd in while in directory c, does it show or not, also after i "cd ..",
does "pwd" work or no, because for our code it's not working, if it works in bash, well i just tried it 
prints the pwd, so if pwd is written to command line just search the env list and print that


i will do export tomorrow easy fix,
handle export use isdigit first letter shouldnt be a "digit" if it is should return an error
and after the the letter we can have numbers but no symbols so check if alphnum
bash: export: `5': not a valid identifier

echo $? -> 1

dont forget to free in unset cause now i am ft_strdup content of list, 
also fix the while loop for export, current = data->envir should be inside the big loop & b4 inner loop

look at strncmp in cd should they be the var name size or +1??





run all test tomorrow and check if new code works then push
