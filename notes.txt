Error message for cd, 
cd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
Echo $? -> 0


Well I delete the parent directory and I am inside the child directory, 
when I try to cd .. chdir doesn’t fail but If I add error message in get_pwd 
It will be printed out twice, and pads in the env list is fucked in this situation, 
maybe I need to handle “..” Path on its own in a separate function, where I check 
if the directory is available is something

handle export use isdigit first letter shouldnt be a "digit" if it is should return an error
and after the the letter we can have numbers but no symbols so check if alphnum
bash: export: `5': not a valid identifier

echo $? -> 1
